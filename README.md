Prismic is a collection of `TextRenderer` examples for SwiftUI apps, showing how you can render text in different ways with special effects. 

Some effects use pure Swift code, and others bring in Metal distortion and color shaders to produce more advanced effects.


## See it in action

This repository contains a macOS sample project demonstrating all the example renderers in action. The sample project is built using SwiftUI and macOS 15 or later. The text renderers can be used on other platforms – iOS 18 or later, visionOS 2 or later, and so on.
